# Discord IRC CSS
Custom CSS for Discord that styles usernames of Discord messages and messages coming in through an IRC bridge seamlessly.

![Style example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2603160/113452077-9628c880-9403-11eb-9961-38953337036e.png)

Furthermore, it shrinks a number of elements to make better use of screen real-estate, optimised for putting Discord on half of a screen.


## Installation
* Install [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/betterdiscord/installer).
* Copy-paste the CSS contents of `style.css` into the 'Custom CSS' settings added to the Discord settings.
